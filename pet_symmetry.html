Pet Symmetry is the playful pop-punk/power-pop project of emo stalwart Even Weiss and his close friends. What started as an escape from the serious, introspective nature of their other projects (Into It. Over It, Dowsing) evolved into a full-fledged band formed to remind you that listening to music can still be an enjoyable experience. This collection of upbeat, quick, and energizing tunes are sure to satisfy your inner punk with every listen.
